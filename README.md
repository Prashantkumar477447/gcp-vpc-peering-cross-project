# GCP VPC Peering Across Projects

This repository provides step-by-step instructions and Terraform/IaC templates (if needed) for setting up **VPC Network Peering between two different Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects**.

## 📌 Overview

VPC Network Peering allows private connectivity across two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks in GCP. This setup enables secure and high-performance internal traffic between resources in two separate GCP projects, without traversing the public internet.

### 🔗 Key Use Case

- Internal communication between services hosted in **Project A** and **Project B**.
- Centralized networking (shared VPC model alternative).
- Hybrid architectures and service segregation by project.

## 🧭 Architecture Diagram

Project A (VPC-A)                     Project B (VPC-B)
+------------------+                 +------------------+
|  Subnet A        | <-- Peering --> |  Subnet B        |
|  VM, GKE, etc.   |                 |  VM, GKE, etc.   |
+------------------+                 +------------------+

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Two existing GCP projects (with billing enabled)
- VPCs already created in both projects
- Proper IAM roles:
  - **Network Admin** on both projects
  - **Project Editor/Owner** (for creating peering and permissions)

---

## 🔧 Steps to Configure VPC Peering

### ✅ 1. Enable APIs

In both projects:
```bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
````

### ✅ 2. Create VPC Peering from Project A

```bash
gcloud compute networks peerings create peering-to-b \
  --network=VPC_A \
  --peer-project=PROJECT_B_ID \
  --peer-network=VPC_B \
  --auto-create-routes \
  --project=PROJECT_A_ID
```

### ✅ 3. Create VPC Peering from Project B

```bash
gcloud compute networks peerings create peering-to-a \
  --network=VPC_B \
  --peer-project=PROJECT_A_ID \
  --peer-network=VPC_A \
  --auto-create-routes \
  --project=PROJECT_B_ID
```

### ✅ 4. Verify Peering

In either project:

```bash
gcloud compute networks peerings list --project=PROJECT_A_ID
```

Check status is `ACTIVE` and `PEERING`.

## 🔐 IAM Permissions Required

| Role                     | Resource Scope        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Compute Network Admin    | Both Projects         |
| Project Viewer (minimum) | Cross-project peering |

---

## 🚧 Notes

* Peering is **not transitive**: If Project A is peered with B, and B with C, A cannot reach C.
* CIDR ranges in the VPCs **must not overlap**.
* No NAT or Internet Gateway is involved; traffic is private.
